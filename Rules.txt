	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The game is played between you, the player, and the Dealer (computer).
	The aim is to get 21 or as close to 21 as possible.
	At the start both you and the dealer are dealt two cards.
	You are then presented with two options in each turn: 
	Hit: means you are dealt another card.
	Stand: means you want to "stand" with your cards and not be dealt another card.
	When you "Stand", if the dealer's cards total less than 17 he will deal himself another card.
	The game then checks the winner.

	Betting Conditions:
	You can bet any amount greater than 10, but less than your money held.

	Winning Conditions:
	For a win you win double the amount, and for loss you lose your bet.
	If you get a straight 21 you win!
	If the dealer gets a 21 you lose!
	If your card total is greater than the dealers but less than 21 you Win!
	If both your total and dealer total is equal you lose!
	If both you and the dealer's card total is above 21, then the closest to 21 wins!
